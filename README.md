### Welcome there âœŒ

My name is ThÃ©o, I'm a french student ðŸ¥– at ENSTA Paris on the Paris-Saclay campus. On my free time, I climb, practice twisty puzzles (Rubik's Cube) and code various projects! I'm also interested in AI and machine learning ðŸ§ 

My main programming languages are **Golang**, **JavaScript** (with **Vue.js**), **OCaml** and **C**. I usually code on Linux and play games on Windows.

Regarding my coding activity, I keep [many repositories](https://github.com/theovidal?tab=repositories&type=source), among which my main projects are:

- A climbing app called **[Highest](https://highest.netlify.app)** to track your activity
- The website and other stuff on the **[BecauseOfProg](https://becauseofprog.fr)**, a developers team I founded in 2017
- **Discord and Telegram bots** for utilities and games
- Various stuff for [school](https://github.com/theovidal/school-projects) and my personal learning
