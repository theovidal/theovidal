### Welcome there ✌

My name is Théo, I'm a french student in a M.Sc. in Engineering at [ENSTA](https://ensta-paris.fr/en), on the Paris-Saclay campus. On my free time, I climb, practice twisty puzzles (Rubik's Cube) and code various projects! I'm also interested in AI and Machine Learning 🧠

My main programming languages are **Python**, **MATLAB**, **C**, **C++**, including self-taught **Golang** and **JavaScript** (mainly with **Vue.js**), and I use Linux and JetBrains IDEs to code.

I keep [many repositories](https://github.com/theovidal?tab=repositories&type=source), among which my main projects are:

- 💻 Machine Learning projects: [climbing routes classification](https://github.com/theovidal/beta-project) 🧗‍♂️,  and [frugal AIs](https://github.com/theovidal/frugal-ai-challenge) 🍃
- 🏃‍♂️ ML Hackathons: [water shortages prediction](https://github.com/theovidal/hickathon) 💧, [LLM agent for 3D prototyping](https://github.com/theovidal/joyero-mit-hackathon) 🤖
- 🍯 A [numerical analysis of dripping honey](https://github.com/theovidal/ipt-bouncing-honey), to conduct physics research for the [International Physicists' Tournament](https://iptnet.info)
- 📣 Experiments and simulations to [characterise and improve room acoustics](https://github.com/theovidal/room-acoustics)
- 🔭 Physics simulations: [solid mechanics](https://github.com/theovidal/fisiks) ⛰️ and [fluid mechanics](https://github.com/theovidal/study-projects/tree/main/mechanics/stokes-equation-simulation) 🌊
- 🚗 A [computer vision algorithm](https://github.com/theovidal/vehicule-vision) based on colors and shapes
- 🚁 [UAV trajectory planner](https://github.com/theovidal/tipe) for post-earthquake reconnaissance, using topography and population densities
- 🔦 A [3D cartography platform](https://github.com/theovidal/3d-cartography-platform), using a LiDAR scanner and remote communication to display in real time the point cloud and perform calculation

Older projects (high school or before) include:

- 🧗‍♂️ A [climbing app](https://highest.netlify.app) to track your activity and set your goals
- 🤖 Discord and [Telegram](https://github.com/theovidal/parcolar) bots for utilities and games
- 🎓 ...and [many study projects](https://github.com/theovidal/study-projects), including a Tic-tac-toe in the terminal, or a Sudoko solver using SAT

I sometimes write articles (in French) for [the BecauseOfProg blog](https://becauseofprog.fr) 📑
